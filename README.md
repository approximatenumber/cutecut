# cutecut
Easy utility to cut and crop scanned images and converting them to PDF-book.

### Dependencies
* `imghdr.py` (included, because my `pip` can`t find it)
* `wand`

### Usage
`python cutecut.py <directory-with-scanned-images>`

As a result, ready images or ready PDF-file will be located in `<directory-with-scanned-images>/exported`.
